### AC Framework Core Skills

| Skill | Description | Primary Use | Required Before |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `acfm-spec-workflow` | **START HERE - MANDATORY** - Understand the spec-driven workflow, directory structure (.acfm/ vs openspec/), and CLI commands. Essential before using any OpenSpec skills. | Foundation | **ANYTHING ELSE** |
| `acfm-memory` | **PERSISTENT MEMORY PROTOCOL** - Consult memory at the start of every new chat/session, recall relevant project context, and automatically save reusable decisions and patterns after significant work. Prefer the available memory tool/MCP and use CLI fallback when needed. | Knowledge persistence | Session start and after significant work |

### Persistent Memory Protocol (Mandatory)

The AC Framework includes a persistent memory system that agents must use proactively.

**Session-start requirement (always):**
1. At the start of every new chat/session, consult the available persistent memory tool or MCP before planning, implementing, or giving project-specific guidance.
2. Recall project-level context first, then search for task-specific decisions, conventions, bugfixes, and architecture notes.
3. Treat recalled memory as active project context unless the current repository state or an explicit user instruction supersedes it.
4. If memory tooling is unavailable, continue with repository inspection and use the AC Framework CLI fallback when possible.

**What gets saved automatically:**
- Architectural decisions from proposals/designs
- Bugfix patterns and solutions
- Performance optimizations
- Refactoring techniques
- Security fixes
- API patterns and conventions
- Reusable workflow conventions and project constraints

**How to use memory:**
```text
Preferred: use the available persistent memory tool or MCP for recall, search, save, and project-scoped context.
Fallback: use the AC Framework memory CLI commands when direct tool access is not available.
```
```bash
# Recall relevant context before starting work
acfm memory recall "implementing authentication"

# Search for specific patterns
acfm memory search "JWT token refresh"

# Get full context for current project
acfm memory recall

# View statistics
acfm memory stats
```

**When the agent saves memory (automatic):**
1. After completing proposal.md (saves architectural decisions)
2. After fixing bugs (solutions are stored)
3. After refactoring (techniques are recorded)
4. After optimizations (performance insights)
5. After any significant decision with confidence > 0.7
6. After identifying conventions, constraints, or reusable operating rules worth preserving

**Memory hygiene rules:**
- Save only reusable information likely to matter in future chats.
- Do not save secrets, credentials, tokens, or one-off sensitive data.
- Redact content inside `<private>...</private>` before saving.
- Prefer concise titles, the correct memory type, clear tags, and realistic confidence scores.

**User communication:** "Memory saved: [brief description]" when auto-saving occurs.

### SynapseGrid Collaborative MCP Protocol (Optional)

If SynapseGrid is enabled in `acfm init`, AC Framework installs the collaborative MCP server automatically for detected assistants.

**When to delegate to SynapseGrid:**
- Multi-step features with architecture + implementation + review work
- Tasks requiring critical analysis before coding (security, API contracts, refactors)
- Long-running work where transcript, artifacts, and resumability are important
- Situations where one assistant would benefit from role-based challenge/review

**Role delegation model (what each agent does best):**
- `planner`: breaks down scope, constraints, approach, acceptance criteria
- `critic`: challenges assumptions, finds risks/blind spots, proposes safer alternatives
- `coder`: implements code and applies concrete changes
- `reviewer`: validates quality, consistency with spec/tasks, and production readiness

**Session-start requirement when collaboration is enabled:**
1. Prefer SynapseGrid MCP tools for start/wait/result/cancel/status flows.
2. Use transcript + meeting summary + artifacts as source of truth.
3. If collaborative MCP is unavailable, use equivalent CLI commands.

**Preferred MCP flow (recommended):**
1. `collab_start_session`
2. `collab_invoke_team`
3. `collab_wait_run`
4. `collab_get_result`
5. Optional diagnostics: `collab_get_transcript`, `collab_get_meeting_log`, `collab_status`

**CLI fallback and operations:**
```bash
# Setup/runtime
acfm agents setup
acfm agents runtime install-zellij
acfm agents runtime set auto
acfm agents doctor --verbose

# Start/run
acfm agents start --task "design and implement feature X" --mux auto
acfm agents live
acfm agents status

# Visibility and artifacts
acfm agents transcript --role all --limit 80
acfm agents summary
acfm agents artifacts --watch --interval 1200
acfm agents export --format md --out synapse-session.md

# Model management
acfm agents model list
acfm agents model choose
acfm agents model set --role coder provider/model

# Lifecycle
acfm agents resume
acfm agents stop
```

**Collaboration artifacts (deterministic, not prompt-dependent):**
- `~/.acfm/synapsegrid/<sessionId>/transcript.jsonl`
- `~/.acfm/synapsegrid/<sessionId>/meeting-log.md`
- `~/.acfm/synapsegrid/<sessionId>/meeting-summary.md`
- `~/.acfm/synapsegrid/<sessionId>/turns/*.json`
- `~/.acfm/synapsegrid/<sessionId>/turns/raw/*.ndjson`
- `~/.acfm/synapsegrid/<sessionId>/turns/raw/*.stderr.log`
- `~/.acfm/synapsegrid/<sessionId>/diagnostics.json`

**Troubleshooting and robust behavior:**
- Use `acfm agents doctor --verbose` for capability probe diagnostics.
- In `--mux auto`, runtime prefers zellij and falls back to tmux when zellij startup fails.
- If model/provider errors appear, validate with `opencode auth list` and `opencode models`.
- If workers are running but unclear, inspect `logs`, `transcript`, and `artifacts` before restarting.

**Conditional Skills Notes:**
- `[IF REACT]`: Use vercel-react-best-practices only if the project uses React or Next.js
- `[IF APIs]`: Use api-design-principles only if the project involves REST/GraphQL APIs
- `[IF UI]`: Use interface-design only if the project has dashboards, admin panels, or apps
- `microtask-decomposition`: Use ONLY when a single task from tasks.md is still too complex (3+ files). NOT for initial breakdown.

**Conditional Skills Notes:**
- `[IF APIs]`: Use api-design-principles only if modifying/creating REST/GraphQL APIs
- `[IF UI]`: Use interface-design only if modifying dashboards, admin panels, or apps
- `project-index`: Run only if you haven't indexed the project yet or need to refresh context

## Skill Loading Reference

All skills are located in: `skills/`

To load a skill, read its SKILL.md file:
- Example: Read `skills/spec-clarification/SKILL.md` to use the clarification workflow
- Example: Read `skills/interface-design/SKILL.md` to use interface design principles

### MANDATORY SKILL EXECUTION CHECKLIST

Before claiming a skill is "done", verify:
- [ ] I have read the entire SKILL.md file
- [ ] I have executed ALL steps in the skill
- [ ] I have the required output artifacts
- [ ] I can answer: "What did this skill produce?"

**Remember**: Skills are documentation-based workflows with ZERO SKIP policy. Load them by reading the SKILL.md files, execute CLI commands when instructed, and NEVER proceed without completing all steps.

## VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

If you SKIP a skill or phase:
1. The framework integrity is compromised
2. Quality cannot be guaranteed
3. You MUST go back and complete what was skipped
4. No exceptions. No shortcuts. Follow the workflow.

**Quality over speed. Documentation before code. Planning before execution.**
